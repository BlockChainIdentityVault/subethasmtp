# Run a demo SubethaSMTP Server #

1. Download the most recent `subethasmtp.jar` file from the releases section on Github
2. Run the command `java -cp subetha.jar org.sebethamail.examples.BasicSMTPServer`
3. Use `TELNET` or an SMTP client to connect to the now-running server on TCP port 25000.


# Enable logging #

Note that SubethaSMTP uses the SLF4J logging framework. When the program starts up, it will look for a compatible logging connector in the classpath. If none is found it will print a warning message to the console and then silently toss any log messages generated by the program.   

If you want to see the logging messages, you need a compatible connector in the classpath. 

You can download connectors from the [SLF4J website](http://www.slf4j.org/download.html). The `Simple` connector is very simple and just prints log messages to stderr.  Note that the version of the connector must match the version that SubethaSMTP was built against.
